After completing the hardware platform setup, I conducted research on the popular frameworks used in aerial robots, legged robots, and mobile robots. Considering the goal of developing a mobile robot capable of autonomous navigation in wild environments, I have identified the subsequent research direction. The initial focus will be on implementing a perception-to-control software stack within the traditional hierarchical framework, incorporating learning-based approaches to address the challenges that traditional methods face in the wild. Subsequently, research will be conducted on end-to-end methods based on this framework. In order to facilitate testing, the hierarchical framework was implemented in the order of control to perception.","location":{"address":"2712 Broadway St","postalCode":"CA 94115","city":"San Francisco","countryCode":"US","region":"California"},"profiles":[{"network":"Twitter","username":"AlbertEinstein","url":"https://twitter.com/AlbertEinstein"}]}}
