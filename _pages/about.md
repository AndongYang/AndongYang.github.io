Welcome! This is Andong Yang, and I am a PhD student studying robot motion planning and motion control.

I hope to make progress in the field of motion planning and motion control for mobile robot in wild environments. If you have any questions, please feel free to send me an email: andong_yang[at]outlook.com. Good luck!

<!-- In 2019, I received my bachelor's degree and was recommended to a straight-to Ph.D. My work started with building and modifying multiple mobile robots and simulator platforms (Including two mobile robots and one SUV) since I was the first student in the lab to start research in this area. After completing the hardware platform setup, I conducted research on the popular frameworks used in aerial robots, legged robots, and mobile robots. Considering the goal of developing a mobile robot capable of autonomous navigation in wild environments, I have identified the subsequent research direction. The initial focus will be on implementing a perception-to-control software stack within the traditional hierarchical framework, incorporating learning-based approaches to address the challenges that traditional methods face in the wild. Subsequently, research will be conducted on end-to-end methods based on this framework. In order to facilitate testing, the hierarchical framework was implemented in the order of control to perception. Specific works include:

1. A motion control method for rugged outdoor environments.
2. A Speed planning method that can handle the geometric and semantic features of the terrain.
3. A motion planning method that can utilize long-range information.
4. A set of OctoMap generation processes and terrain semantic segmentation methods.
5. A meethod for automatic simulator terrain generation and texture generation.

Based on this software stack, I further explored an end-to-end trajectory planning method that can be trained offline. Other work includes an active SLAM method based on hierarchical reinforcement learning for fast exploration, as well as A city-scale neural radiance fields (NeRF). -->

Since I received my bachelor's degree and was recommended to a stright-to Ph.D. I stared working with the planning and control algorithms of mobile robots in wild environments. My work started with building multiple mobile robots and simulator platforms since I was the first student in the lab to start research in this area. This process includes a complete pipeline from perception to control. In the follow-up research, to alleviate the prediction error course by inaccurate dynamic model and significant time overhead course by multi-step prediction process in model prediction control, I proposed SMS-MPC based on a generative adversarial model, which was published in IROS2022. To make the speed planning algorithm can perceive the terrain information and quickly plan reasonable speed under multiple constraints. I propose a new speed planning algorithm based on constraint reinforcement learning, which is submitted to RAL and currently under review. At present, I am trying to solve the local optimal problem faced by motion planning of mobile robot in the wild environment. In addition, I have collaborated on a SLAM method based on hierarchical reinforcement learning in the past year, which was published in IROS2023.  -->
